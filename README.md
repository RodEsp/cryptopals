# cryptopals
My attempt to understand and solve the problems at [cryptopals.com](https://www.cryptopals.com/) using Rust.

## Structure of this repository

Each challenge is expressed as a test in the [./tests](./tests) directory. A passing test means the challenge has been solved.<br/>
**DO NOT** look at the files in [./tests](./tests) unless you don't care about spoiling the answers to the challenges.

Meanwhile, the code that actually solves the challenges is presented as a library with different modules in [./src](./src).
